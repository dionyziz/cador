# Reading
I believe this is a good educational piece of software in C++ with clear code and structure, and a good example of Object-oriented programming. It's also a working example of a full net server, yet simple enough to be read and fully understood in a couple of hours by a C++ student with a medium knowledge of C++. If you want to study it, start at cador.cpp which is where the main function is defined and work your way through the functions it uses from there.
